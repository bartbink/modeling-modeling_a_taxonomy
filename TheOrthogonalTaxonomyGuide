# The Orthogonal Taxonomy Guide: A Rulebook for Semantic Modeling

## 1. Core Philosophy
This guide establishes a "Pure," **Faceted Classification** system. Instead of rigid single-inheritance trees which often force arbitrary choices (e.g., *"Is a pile of rocks primarily a physical object or a collection?"*), this approach models reality as a coordinate system.

**The Golden Rules:**
1.  **Orthogonality:** If a distinction applies to multiple branches of a concept, it is not a child of those branches. It is a separate, independent **Dimension**.
2.  **Intersection:** A specific concept (like "Hammer") is defined by the **intersection** of values from these dimensions.
3.  **Need Basis:** Only expand the taxonomy or add a dimension when a concrete distinction is required that existing dimensions cannot capture.
4.  **Disjointness:** Sibling concepts within a single dimension must be mutually exclusive.

## 2. The Foundation: 4 Core Dimensions (The Coordinate System)
We begin with the universal set. To define any concept, we "toggle" values from these three orthogonal dimensions. These apply to `Anything`. These first four dimensions are created by simply determining what a hammer is, accompanied by taxonomy rules. A new dimension may be needed at a later time.

* **Root Concept:** `Anything`

### Dimension A: Temporality
We split the root based on the most fundamental mode of existence.

**The Question:** *How does this entity relate to time?*
* **Continuant:** Entities that endure through time and exist fully at any single moment (e.g., Objects, Spatial Regions).
* **Occurrent:** Entities that happen or unfold over time; they have temporal parts (e.g., Processes, Events).
* **Atemporal:** Entities that exist outside of time (e.g., Abstract mathematics, logic).

### Dimension B: Materiality (Substance)
**The Question:** *Does this entity consist of physical matter/energy?*
* **Material:** Has mass, energy, and physical presence.
* **Immaterial:** Abstract, structural, conceptual, or void (e.g., A hole, a plan, a legal code, information).

### Dimension C: Multiplicity (Unity)
**The Question:** *Is this entity a single unit or a collection?*
* **Atomic:** A unified, singular entity.
* **Collection:** A group/aggregate of entities treated as one item.

### Dimension D: Origin & Status (The User Dimension)
**The Question:** *What is the nature of its existence regarding design and origin?*
* **Natural Entity:** Something that exists as a natural thing (e.g., A rock, A river, A biological cell).
* **Technical Entity:** An artifact made by an agent (human or animal) to fulfill one or more functions (e.g., A pump, A nest, A hammer).
* **Functional Entity:** A conceptual thing that exists in the virtual world, in a design system, or on paper. Often represented as a symbol, function, or description (e.g., The *idea* of a pump, A schematic, A requirement).

## 4. The Modeling Workflow

Follow this step-by-step process when introducing a new concept.

### Step 1: The "Need Basis" Check
* **Scenario:** You need to model a concept (e.g., "Hammer").
* **Action:** Try to define it using *only* the existing dimensions.
    * Is it a Continuant? Yes.
    * Is it Material? Yes.
    * Is it Atomic? Yes.
    * *Dimension C Check:* Is it Natural, Technical, or Functional? **Technical Entity**.

### Step 2: The "Missing Distinction" Check
* **Scenario:** You have defined "Hammer" as `Material + Atomic + Technical Entity`.
* **Conflict:** This definition also fits "Chair" and "Smartphone".
* **Action:** You need a sub-concept or attribute to distinguish them.
    * *Decision:* Distinguish by **Specific Function** (Striking vs. Sitting) or **Category** (Tool vs. Furniture).
    * *Implementation:* Create these as sub-classes of `Technical Entity`.

### Step 3: Attributes & Properties
* **Rule:** Attach properties to the **Dimension** where they universally apply, not the leaf concept.

| Dimension Class | Property | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Material Entity** | `hasMass` | All material things have mass. |
| **Technical Entity** | `fulfilledFunction` | All technical entities are made to fulfill a function. |
| **Technical Entity** | `manufacturedBy` | All technical entities have a maker. |
| **Functional Entity** | `representedBySymbol` | All functional entities (designs) have a representation. |
| **Functional Entity** | `hasRequirementValue` | Designs have target values (e.g., "Target Flow"). |

## 5. Generating Definitions
Definitions are equations generated by walking up the hierarchy.

**The Formula:**
`[Concept] is a [Dimension C] [Dimension B] [Dimension A] [Level 1].`

### Example 1: Defining a "Hammer" (The Real Tool)
1.  **Dim A (Time):** Continuant (Endures)
2.  **Dim B (Materiality):** Material (Physical)
3.  **Dim C (Unity):** Atomic (Single unit)
4.  **Dim D (Status):** Technical Entity (Artifact)

**Generated Definition:**
> "A **Hammer** is a **Technical Entity** (Artifact) existing as an **Atomic**, **Material** **Continuant**."

### Example 2: Defining a "Pump" (The Design/Spec)
*Scenario:* You are calculating the NPSH requirements for a system.
1.  **Dim A (Time):** Continuant (The concept endures)
2.  **Dim B (Materiality):** Immaterial (It is information/virtual)
3.  **Dim C (Unity):** Atomic (One spec)
4.  **Dim D (Status):** Functional Entity (Design/Symbol)

**Generated Definition:**
> "A **Pump (Design)** is a **Functional Entity** (Virtual/Conceptual) existing as an **Immaterial** **Continuant**."

### Example 3: Defining a "River"
1.  **Dim A (Time):** Continuant
2.  **Dim B (Materiality):** Material
3.  **Dim C (Unity):** Atomic (Unified body of water)
4.  **Dim D (Status):** Natural Entity

**Generated Definition:**
> "A **River** is a **Natural Entity** existing as an **Atomic**, **Material** **Continuant**."

## 6. Modeling "Function": Design vs. Evolution
This taxonomy explicitly distinguishes between Artifacts (Technical) and Biology (Natural) by how they relate to Function.

### A. The Design Loop (Technical Entities)
The Function exists _before_ the Object as a requirement (Design).

* **Functional Entity:** The requirement (The "Virtual" Pump).
    * _Properties:_ `targetFlowRate`, `requiredNPSH`.
* **Technical Entity:** The solution (The "Real" Pump).
    * _Properties:_ `actualFlowRate`, `serialNumber`.
* **The Link:**
    * `Technical Entity` -- *satisfies* --> `Functional Entity`

### B. The Evolutionary Loop (Natural Entities)
The Object exists _before_ the Function is defined (Evolution). Nature has no "Functional Entity" (Blueprint).

* **Natural Entity:** The Solution (The "Real" Heart).
    * _Properties:_ strokeVolume, biomaterial.
* **The Function:** A *Role* or *Disposition* the entity has acquired.
    * _Contrast:_ We do not link to a `Functional Entity` because there is no design spec.
* **The Link:** `Natural Entity` -- _hasBiologicalFunction_ --> "Circulating Blood" (Process/Role).
